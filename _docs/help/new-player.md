Wondering what you can _actually_ do in this idle game? Surprisingly, a lot!

### Choices

Choices (Adventurer -> Choices tab) are the primary way you'll interact with IdleLands. You'll see a lot of different choice types, such as a merchant selling items, or a gambling bet. You'll want to check here often if you care about your characters gear, as this is the primary place all items come in from!

### Divine Direction

On the Map screen, you can click anywhere to set a Divine Direction. This means your character will walk towards that location for 360 ticks (30 minutes). This will let you more easily get that class trainer, collectible, or navigate that dungeon.

### Personalities

Personalities (Adventurer -> Personalities tab) are one of the ways you can influence your character more passively. These will allow you to help your character pick equipment automatically, determine how your character interacts with parties, and more.

### Pets

Every adventurer needs a good pet, and you are no exception. In this game, you can buy and upgrade a wide variety of pets, and in turn, those pets will give you a wide variety of bonuses!

### Pet Adventures

To make the most of your collection of pets, you can send them on adventures. Send up to 3 per adventure - the more you send, the more rewards you get.

### Astral Gate

The Astral Gate (Premium -> Astral Gate tab) is one of the things you can do to gain pet enhancement items or more pets. You also get to roll for free daily, so check back often!

### Chat

Of course, a game like this is nothing without its community. Chat, introduce yourself, and enjoy the community!
