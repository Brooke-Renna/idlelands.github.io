Pet Adventures, AKA “How can this pet rock get me items?”

Found in the “Pets” tab, under “Adventures”, pet adventures allow you to send your pets out to gather gold, xp, equipment and other rare items. Up to 3 pets can be sent on one adventure, with more rewards gained for sending multiple pets. Note that your current active pet can be sent on adventures, and this will have no effect on it's regular actions such as assisting in battle or gaining xp. 

All players have a base of 3 Pet Adventures available at one time, and more slots can be gained from certain achievements, by spending ILP, or by having a higher Donator tier. 

All varieties of pet adventure can have 5 different lengths; 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 hours with 8 hours being the most common. This time starts when you send your pet(s) off on their adventure, and counts down even when offline.
