How do I pick up this collectible? It is still is on the ground after I got to it. What do collectibles do?
 
Stepping on a collectible "picks it up".  The icon will remain on the map, but you can mouse over it to see if you've collected it. If you have, after it's name you will see [Owned!] .
 
Collectibles do a few things:
 
* Collecting and touching (stepping on them again after collection) gives you achievements at certain milestones
* Some are required to access certain areas (black/"Godly" collectibles) or pets (green/"Idle" collectibles) 
* They give you ILP, which are used for premium upgrades and the astral gate; higher rarity gives more ILP
* They also spice up the map, and give players an active goal to work on with [Divine Direction (DD)](https://idle.land/docs/divine-direction)
